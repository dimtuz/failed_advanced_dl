It is a Project 1 in my advanced Deep Learning class. I need to address this: 

"The wheels should start turning now - I am giving you leeway on Project 1 to explore something that looks good on your CV. You can do regression like M1_3 with 2D data, or you can push yourself. 
You just need to make sure you are fitting a model (loss curves, error metrics) and performing analysis (SHAP, interval size, inspection of outliers). 
What types of things are your 'best successes' and 'biggest misses'?

You can make an .ipynb that goes out, grabs the data, cleans it up (there are duplicates), and see if your Bayesian(ish) NN can make a better point and interval estimate than baseline.

1) Apply epistemic and aleatoric loss to classification or regression problems. You'll need to ask GenAI how to tweak the M1.3 notebook for this.  
2) Create a one-time analysis or if you want to push yourself, a system that runs 24/7 on GCP. You just need a yml that grabs real-world data every X hours."
